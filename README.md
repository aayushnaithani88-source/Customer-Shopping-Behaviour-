🧠 Workflow / Steps

1. Data Loading

--Loaded the CSV dataset using Pandas.
--Explored basic dataset structure and data types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

--Performed descriptive statistics.
--Checked missing values and duplicates.
--Visualized key variables using histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.

3. Data Cleaning

--Handled missing values.
--Corrected inconsistent formats.
--Removed outliers where appropriate.
--Standardized text fields.

4. SQL Analysis

--Imported the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.
--Executed SQL queries to compute:
    (a)Average purchase behavior
    (b)Discount impact
    (c)Customer segments
    (d)Aggregated KPIs

5. Power BI Dashboard
